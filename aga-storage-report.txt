Ideas

* Ignore empty rows
* Rows with only bold are headers.
  * First bold in a column is the section.
  * Second bold is the sub-section.
* Row with one bold and many roman ("Estimated Full") is an aggregate.
  * Same sections and sub-sections
* What output data structure?

What if the goal is just to find the horizontal and vertical divisions
of things? We write one-dimensional parsers for the rows and the columns
and thus divide the grid into many sub-grids.

For the present sheet, here are the row types. These appear in blocks;
all of the sheet headers come first, then come all the column headers,
then aggregates, then body rows.

Sheet header
    The first cell is bold, and all other cells are empty. 
Column header
    All cells in the row are either bold or empty.
Aggregate
    The first cell, and only the first cell, is bold. Several others are roman.
    These have equal priority in the order; we can alternate between column headers
    and aggregates.
Body row
    The row has at least one filled cell, and all filled cells are roman.

Here are the column types.

Grouped column
    Contains a cell that is merged to the left or to the right (or both).
Single column
    Contains values and contains no merged cell

There are also the empty row and column, which may appear anywhere and is ignored.
Or we could put meaning in these; for example, we could say that the body must be
composed of alternations between six body rows and two empty rows.

After we do all this, we wind up with 4 row types x 2 column types = 8 cell group
types. We could parse rows and columns separately to come up with headers and then
pass them to the two dimensional groups. Hmm...
